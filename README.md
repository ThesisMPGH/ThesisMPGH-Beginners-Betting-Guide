# Basic Terminology 
Bankroll - The amount of money that you have set aside to bet with.
Sportsbook - A place where you can place bets.
Spread - An example would be, Philadelphia Eagles +6. This would mean that the Philadelphia Eagles would have a 6 point advantage 
when grading the wager.
Line - A bet that contains decent value.
Grading - When a sportsbook finishes a wager.
Cover - To beat the pointspread by the required number of points. When you win, you have "covered the spread."

# Managing your bankroll
A unit should be 1%/1.5%/3% of your entire bankroll. Obviously this can be adjusted for bankrolls under $100. 
If your bankroll is under $100, then I would recommend a 5% unit. 
You sohuld re-calculate your unit size after your bankroll has moved ~15%.
